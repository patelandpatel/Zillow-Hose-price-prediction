# Zillow-Hose-price-prediction

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning system to predict house prices using Zillow data. The model analyzes various home features and market indicators to estimate property values accurately.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning pipeline
- Feature engineering for real estate metrics
- Machine learning models optimized for price prediction
- Evaluation metrics and visualization tools
- API for integrating predictions into applications

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zillow-house-price-prediction.git
   cd zillow-house-price-prediction
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Data Preparation
1. Place your Zillow dataset in the `data/raw/` directory
2. Run the preprocessing script:
   ```
   python src/preprocessing/preprocess.py
   ```

### Training Models
```
python src/models/train_model.py --config config/model_config.yaml
```

### Making Predictions
```
python src/models/predict.py --input data/examples/sample_home.csv --output predictions.csv
```

### Running the API
```
python src/api/app.py
```
The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`
